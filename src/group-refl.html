                       For this course, our group members have a lot to learn from one another because this is our
                       first time working together. Even though everything went according to plan, there are still a
                       few things that could have been done more efficiently and effectively. As we have stressed
                       throughout the course, effective communication and collaboration are critical components of
                       successfully completing a task on time. Recognizing the importance of this factor, we will talk
                       about our team's progress throughout the course, as well as our long-term objectives. To begin,
                       our communication is flawless for a team that has only recently established itself in this
                       course, we never miss meetings, and our team consistently completes work ahead of schedule.
                       Additionally, we usually have a meeting together outside of school to strengthen our ties and
                       improve our communication with and among one another. As a result of everyone contributing their
                       best efforts and assisting one another in overcoming our individual weaknesses, we are pleased
                       with the outcome of our project. Despite our team's high level of achievement, there is always
                       room for improvement. When it comes to decision-making, we frequently pause and take an extended
                       period of time to reach a conclusion due to our inexperience and lack of familiarity with one
                       another. We were surprised at how close we had become after completing the course. We have
                       developed into more than teammates; we have developed into friends, which our group considers a
                       success. We know that we can rely on one another for the next couple of courses, and our
                       teamwork will undoubtedly improve as a result. After a period of collaboration, we determined
                       that adhering to deadlines and holding weekly meetings are critical components of any project.
                       Deadlines help us plan for the future and brainstorm what we need to accomplish throughout the
                       week. Additionally, we learn that setting aside some spare time is necessary due to the
                       frequency with which problems arise during an assignment. Additionally, having a weekly meeting
                       on a specific day is critical because it enables us to monitor the project's progress while also
                       discussing what we should and should not do to improve the overall quality of the project.
                       Additionally, it aids us in resolving any issues that arise as a team, ensuring that the
                       solutions are optimal. After completing this course, we will have gained practical experience
                       working in teams, particularly in the information technology industry, and we will be able to
                       devise a more effective method of collaboration for future projects.

                       12 weeks went by in a blink of an eye, and everything has turned out to be better than we
                       expected. We went into this class as total strangers, and after two assignments together, came
                       out as friends, which is something I cannot say for most of the other teams I have seen during
                       my study. We respected each other’s opinion and perspective during each and every team meeting,
                       always strived to reach a common consensus on how our project should look, feel, and function.
                       Though one downside of such a democratic approach was the fact that it dragged everything on
                       considerably.

                       Being the oldest member of the group, it is refreshing to be surrounded by such youthful and
                       energetic teammates. Thu, whilst a bit shy, demonstrated her strengths in coding and web
                       programming extensively during the creation of our website. Tri, our entertainer, was always
                       lively and knew how to cheer us up whenever we were stressed. And My, our youngest member,
                       sailed the team through both assignments smoothly thanks to her attentiveness and dedication to
                       our team. As the person with the final say on how the team should run, I believe My could be
                       more assertive and self-assured when it comes to decision making. But when all is said and done,
                       this was arguably, one of the best team-working experiences I have ever had at RMIT, and I wish
                       my underclassmen more successful projects and/or assignments to come.

                       After two months of collaborating with these three enthusiastic and hard-working people, I have
                       learned a lot of new things, such as patience, teamwork, decision-making, and web programming
                       languages. Even though several challenges developed during the working process (unable to export
                       the file and run the game, and decision-making difficulties), we nonetheless successfully
                       managed and tackled these issues in the end. However, nothing is flawless, and I think that our
                       team still needs some critical feedback for ongoing progress. In the meeting, several members of
                       the team (including myself) were not really active and involved in the meeting. As for myself, I
                       am a listener and I am shy about giving my opinions. Consequently, this is not a constructive
                       mode of communication. Nevertheless, by the end of this course, I am more confident and willing
                       to express my ideas and feedback on other members’ work. One thing that surprised me is that Vu
                       Le has great performance and productivity. I asked him to add some improvements to his work, and
                       roughly 20 minutes later, he sent me his update. To sum up, each participant had dedicated their
                       time and effort to this project, and I am extremely delighted with the result of our project.

                       When I transferred to RMIT University from a private, well-known high school in Vietnam, I
                       immediately noticed how much the working style and assignment format resembled what I was used
                       to. As a result, I possess a number of distinct advantages that proved instrumental in
                       contributing to the team's work. Even though the team's communication was consistent and
                       efficient, as a patient listener, I noticed that it was not particularly productive. It was a
                       positive experience, especially during the decision-making phases, when everyone was mostly
                       compliant and in agreement with the possible options. As a result, I took the initiative to
                       conduct extensive research in order to gain additional technical expertise, which enabled me to
                       feel more confident and active during team discussions and selections. I discovered my potential
                       ability to focus on specific tasks unintentionally during my work with my teammates. I've always
                       suspected that my naturally bubbly and spontaneous personality interferes with my ability to
                       concentrate and divide my attention span, preventing me from fully committing to a task when
                       multiple tasks are required. However, when faced with three separate Intro courses' deadlines in
                       the same week, I was able to practice and hone my ability to maintain concentration. Rather than
                       discouraging me, the overwhelming amount of work instills in me a strong sense of motivation to
                       take the initiative and give my all.

                       In general, I believe that the group as a whole was extremely dedicated and committed to
                       bringing the somewhat implausible game concept to life. If I had to choose a single word to
                       describe our entire group work experience, it would be "Harmonious." Since the group's
                       inception, during the idea generation and research phase, our team has been extremely respectful
                       of one another's opinions and willing to expand our idea options. However, our mutual regard for
                       one another inevitably complicates decision-making. This occurs as a result of everyone's
                       compliant and general positivity with the proposed topics, not leaning toward any specific idea.
                       Thus, having an individual with strong preferences for a particular option was critical in order
                       to provide counter arguments for others and motivate the team to think more critically. With
                       regards to the project's concept, because our chosen subject denotes a fairly complex and
                       involved subject, our team has encountered several difficulties collaborating and resolving
                       inevitable problems. Choosing the most appropriate game engines proved to be one of the most
                       difficult aspects. Because the same situation of indecision could have occurred during this
                       phase, I proposed that the game development team (Thu, Tri, and me) each conduct independent
                       research on the various game engine options and be prepared to discuss several critical points,
                       such as whether we want to create an app or a web game, the advantages and disadvantages of each
                       popular and well-known game engine, and whether our game requires specific specialized features.
