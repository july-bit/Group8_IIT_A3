                       There are various tools and technologies that are required for the creation of the game as well

                       <b style="color: #E07A5F;">GameMaker Studio 2 version 2.3.6:</b> This free licenses game engine is ultimately designed for
                       making a basic 2D game. The lack of experience in programming and using the game engine requires
                       Thu, Tri, and My many weeks to get used to it. At first, Tri used this tool to create the main
                       menu, but he had some technical problems when exporting the zip file and running the game. Tri
                       then went to the internet and found how to solve this problem, but our group thinks it is
                       challenging to make the demo in 4 weeks since we are all amateurs.
